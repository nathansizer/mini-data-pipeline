## Task Outline
- Scrape basic football data from Transfermarkt and FBRef for the 2024/25 Championship season.
- Store raw data in cloud object storage.
- Transform and load it into a data warehouse/table format.
- Create a one page insight summary - player or team overview.

## Deliverables
- A short README to explain architecture, design decisions, setup instructions etc. (This file covers this).
- Python code (In this repo).
- Cloud integration.
- 1 page PDF of insight from the data.
- Notebook or report with workings for insights and visualizations.

## My Process and Decisions

Firstly, I wanted to tackle the FBRef API. Unfortunately I keep receiving HTTP 500 errors (internal server error), so without knowing the ins and outs, I have written code which I believe should work when the server is capable of filling the request. As a workaround to this, I have taken the example team data from the FBR API, which is for Arsenal in the 2018/19 season. I'm aware this isn't specifically what the task brief wanted, however given the apparent limitations the API was facing, having some data for the later steps of the task is better than having none at all.
